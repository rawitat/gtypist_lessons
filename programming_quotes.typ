*:GENERAL
B:General Wisdoms in Programming and Code Writing

*:G_1
I:[1] Abelson & Sussman, SICP, preface to the 1st edition
S:First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just
 :a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a
 :novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology.
 :
 :Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally
 :for machines to execute.

*:G_2
I:[2] George Boole, quoted in Iverson's Turing Award Lecture
S:That language is an instrument of human reason, and not
 :merely a medium for the expression of thought, is a truth
 :generally admitted.

*:G_3
I:[3] Olin Shivers
S:I object to doing things that computers can do.

*:G_4
I:[4] Cyril Connolly
S:Imprisoned in every fat man a thin man is wildly signaling
 :to be let out.

*:G_5
I:[5] Kernighan and Ritchie
S:The only way to learn a new programming language is by
 :writing programs in it.

*:G_6
I:[6] Dave Moon
S:Language designers are not intellectuals.  They're not as
 :interested in thinking as you might hope.  They just want to
 :get a language done and start using it.

*:G_7
I:[7] Guy Steele
S:The continuation that obeys only obvious stack semantics,
 :O grasshopper, is not the true continuation.

*:G_8
I:[8] Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy
S:The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of
 :special cases.

*:G_9
I:[9] Alan Kay
S:Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do.
 :The best way to predict the future is to invent it.

*:G_10
I:[10] Linus Torvalds
S:Talk is cheap.  Show me the code.

*:G_11
I:[11] Why The Lucky Stiff
S:When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes
 :rather than ability.  Your tastes only narrow & exclude people.
 :So create.

*:G_12
I:[12] John Woods
S:Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be
 :a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

*:G_13
I:[13] Martin Fowler
S:Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.  Good programmers
 :write code that humans can understand.

*:G_14
I:[14] Donald E. Knuth, "Selected Papers on Computer Science"
S:The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform
 :them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly.
 :A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic
 :and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate
 :the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results
 :will be correct.

*:G_15
I:[15] Kent Beck
S:I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.

*:G_16
I:[16] Robert C. Martin, "Clean Code"
S:Truth can only be found in one place: the code.

*:G_17
I:[17] Muhammad Waseem
S:Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day.
 :Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.

*:G_18
I:[18] Alan J. Perlis
S:A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming
 :is not worth knowing.

*:G_19
I:[19] Edward V. Berard
S:Walking on water and developing software from a specification
 :are easy if both are frozen.

*:G_20
I:[20] Alan Kay
S:The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first
 :programming language.

*:G_21
I:[21] Joseph Weizenbaum
S:The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which
 :he alone is the lawgiver.  No playwright, no stage director, no
 :emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such absolute
 :authority to arrange a stage or field of battle and to command
 :such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.

*:G_22
I:[22] C.A.R Hoare
S:The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes
 :the intention of its user.

*:G_23
I:[23] Marvin Minsky
S:A computer is like a violin.  You can imagine a novice trying first
 :a phonograph and then a violin.  The latter, he says, sounds terrible.
 :That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our
 :computer scientists.  Computer programs are good, they say, for
 :particular purposes, but they aren't flexible.  Neither is a violin,
 :a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.

*:G_24
I:[24] Robert C. Martin
S:Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately
 :express the requirements.  We may create languages that are closer
 :to the requirements.  We may create tools that help us parse and
 :assemble those requirements into formal structures.  But we will
 :never eliminate necessary precision - so there will always be code.

*:G_25
I:[25] Eric Raymond
S:Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer
 :any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an
 :expert painter.

*:G_26
I:[26] L. Peter Deutsch
S:To iterate is human, to recurse is divine.

*:G_27
I:[27] Anonymous
S:The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are
 :only off by a bit.

*:G_28
I:[28] Bjarne Stroustrup
S:There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always
 :bitch about and those nobody uses.

*:G_29
I:[29] Brian Kernighan
S:Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.

*:G_30
I:[30] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about programs
 :without thinking of them as pieces of executable code.

*:G_31
I:[31] Steve Jobs
S:Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because
 :it teaches you how to think.

*:G_32
I:[32] C.A.R Hoare
S:The code is like humor: When you have to explain it, it's bad.

*:G_33
I:[33] Why The Lucky Stiff
S:Programming is rather thankless.  You see your works become replaced by
 :superior ones in a year, unable to run at all in a few more.

*:G_34
I:[34] Alan J. Perlis
S:When someone say: "I want a programming language in which I need only say
 :what I wish done", give him a lollipop.

*:G_35
I:[35] Alan J. Perlis
S:A programming language is low-level when its programs require attention
 :to the irrelevant.

*:G_36
I:[36] Alan J. Perlis
S:The best book on programming for the layman is 'Alice in Wonderland';
 :but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.
 
*:G_37
I:[37] Donald Knuth
S:Everyday life is like programming, I guess.
 :If you love something you can put beauty into it.

*:G_38
I:[38] Paul Graham
S:A programming language is for thinking about programs, not for expressing
 :programs you've already thought of.  It should be a pencil, not a pen.

*:GENERAL_2
B:General Wisdoms in Programming and Code Writing #2

*:G2_1
I:[1] Kernighan & Plauger, "The Elements of Programming Style"
S:Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats much of the purpose of using one.

*:G2_2
I:[2] Henry Spencer
S:If you lie to the compiler, it will have its revenge.

*:G2_3
I:[3] Bell Labs saying
S:Some languages are designed to solve a problem.
 :Others are designed to prove a point.

*:G2_4
I:[4] Ken Thompson
S:When in doubt, use brute force.

*:G2_5
I:[5] John F. Kennedy
S:Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all.

*:G2_6
I:[6] B.F. Skinner
S:The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do.

*:G2_7
I:[7] Jeff Scholnik
S:Who cares how it works, just as long as it gives the right answer?

*:G2_8
I:[8] Bill Gates
S:The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation
 :applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency.
 :The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will
 :magnify the inefficiency.

*:G2_9
I:[9] Andrew Orlowski
S:See, no matter how clever your automation systems might be, it all falls
 :apart if your human wetware isn't up to the job.

*:G2_10
I:[10] John Backus
S:I think conventional languages are for the birds.  They're just extensions of
 :the von Neumann computer, and they keep our noses in the dirt of dealing with
 :individual words and computing addresses, and doing all kinds of silly things
 :like that, things that we've picked up from programming for computers; we've
 :built them into programming languages; we've built them into Fortran; we've
 :built them into PL/I; we've built them into almost every language.

*:G2_11
I:[11] Aristophanes
S:High thoughts must have a high language.

*:G2_12
I:[12] Ted Nelson
S:Learning to program has no more to do with designing interactive software
 :than learning to touch type has to do with writing poetry.

*:G2_13
I:[13] Donald E. Knuth
S:People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual
 :reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each
 :other, like a wall of mini stones.

*:G2_14
I:[14] Peter Van Roy, Seif Haridi
S:The most difficult work of programmers, and also the most rewarding, is not
 :writing programs but rather designing abstractions.

*:G2_15
I:[15] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of one's
 :native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer.

*:G2_16
I:[16] Paul Graham, "Beating the Averages"
S:Ordinary technology changes fast.  But programming languages are different:
 :programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in.
 :They're half technology and half religion.  And so the median language, meaning
 :whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.

*:G2_17
I:[17] Alan J. Perlis
S:The computers are never large enough or fast enough.  Each breakthrough in
 :hardware technology leads to more massive programming enterprises, new
 :organizational principles, and an enrichment of abstract models.  Every reader
 :should ask himself periodically "Toward what end, toward what end?" - but do
 :not ask it too often lest you pass up the fun of programming for the
 :constipation of bittersweet philosophy.

*:G2_18
I:[18] Kent Beck, "Test-Driven Development"
S:Paradox: by not considering the future of your code, you make your code much
 :more likely to be adaptable in the future.

*:G2_19
I:[19] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:Software Engineering is Programming when you can't.
 :We must give industry not what it wants, but what it needs.

*:G2_20
I:[20] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:Another series of [philosopher's] stone in the form of "programming tools" is
 :produced under the banner of "software engineering", which, as time went by,
 :has sought to replace intellectual discipline by management discipline to the
 :extent that it has now accepted as its charter "How to program if you cannot".

*:G2_21
I:[21] Curtis Poe, "Finding Technology Solutions"
S:Technology is part of the answer, not part of the question.  Don't make choices
 :only to then try to figure out how to twist the problem in such a way so as to
 :fit your choice.  This will often result in your solution being more convoluted
 :than my previous sentence.

*:G2_22
I:[22] Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., "The Mythical Man-Month"
S:In fact, flow charting is more preached than practiced.  I have never seen an
 :experienced programmer who routinely made detailed flow charts before beginning
 :to write programs.  Where organization standards require flow charts, these
 :are almost invariably done after the fact.  Many shops proudly use machine
 :programs to generate this "indispensable design tool" from the completed code.
 :I think this universal experience is not an embarassing and deplorable
 :departure from good practice, to be acknowledged only with a nervous laugh.
 :Instead it is the application of good judgement, and it teaches us something
 :about the utility of flow charts.

*:G2_23
I:[23] D. Gelernter, "Machine Beauty"
S:Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because
 :software is so complicated.  Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity.
 :The geniuses of the computer field, on the other hand, are the people with
 :keenest aesthetic senses, the ones who are capable of creating beauty.  Beauty
 :is decisive at every level: the most important interfaces, the most important
 :programming languages, the winning algorithms are the beautiful ones.

*:G2_24
I:[24] D. Gelernter, "Machine Beauty"
S:Good programmers know what's beautiful and bad ones don't.

*:G2_25
I:[25] Paul Graham
S:A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanly designed, with
 :a small core of well understood and highly orthogonal operators, but dirty in
 :the sense that it lets hacker have their way with it.
 :
 :A real hacker's language will always have a slightly raffish character.

*:G2_26
I:[26] Paul Graham
S:Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones.  It's usually fairly quick
 :to find a bug in code you just wrote.  When it turns up you often know what's
 :wrong before you even look at the source, because you were already worrying
 :about it subconsciously.  Fixing a bug in something you wrote six months ago
 :(the average case if you release once a year) is a lot more work.  And since
 :you don't understand the code as well, you're more likely to fix it in an ugly
 :way, or even introduce more bugs.

*:G2_27
I:[27] Paul Graham
S:When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compounded bugs.  Compounded
 :bugs are two separate bugs that interact: you trip going downstairs, and when
 :you reach for the handrail it come off in your hand.  In software this kind of
 :bug is the hardest to find, and also tends to have the worst consequences.
 :The traditional "break everything and then filter out the bugs" approach
 :inherently yields a lot of compound bugs.  And software released in a series
 :of small changes inherently tends not to.  The floors are constantly being
 :swept clean of any loose objects that might later get stuck to something.

*:G2_28
I:[28] Paul Graham
S:The way to make programs easy to read is not to stuff them with comments.
 :A good programming language ought to be better for explaining software than
 :English.  You should only need comments when there is some kind of kludge
 :you need to warn readers about, just as on a road there are only arrows on
 :parts with unexpected sharp curves.

*:G2_29
I:[29] R. Hamming
S:The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.

*:G2_30
I:[30] S. Heller, in "Efficient C/C++ Programming"
S:The speed of a non-working program is irrelevant.

*:G2_31
I:[31] G.H. Hardy, in "A Mathematician's Apology"
S:Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for
 :ugly mathematics.

*:G2_32
I:[32] C.A.R Hoare
S:I was eventually persuaded of the need to design programming notations so as
 :to maximize the number of errors which cannot be made, or if made, can be
 :reliably detected at compile time.

*:G2_33
I:[33] C.A.R Hoare
S:In the development of the understanding of complex phenomena, the most powerful
 :tool available to the human intellect is abstraction.  Abstraction arises from
 :recognition of similarities between certain objects, situations, or processes
 :in the real world and the decision to concentrate on these similarities and to
 :ignore, for the time being, their differences.

*:G2_34
I:[34] C.A.R Hoare
S:Inside every well-written large program is a well-written small program.

*:G2_35
I:[35] D. Hock (founder of VISA)
S:The problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind, but
 :how to get old ones out!

*:G3_1
I:[1] D. Jones
S:The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast
 :and much easier to understand.

*:G3_2
I:[2] Alan Kay
S:90% of code written today is getting around other people's mistakes.

*:G3_3
I:[3] Alan Kay
S:Computers are to computing as instruments are to music.  Software is the
 :score whose interpretations amplifies our reach and lifts our spirits.
 :Leonardo da Vinci called music the shaping of the invisible, and his phrase
 :is even more apt as a description of software.

*:G3_4
I:[4] Alan Kay
S:[In a programming language] Simple things should be simple and complex things
 :should be possible.

*:G3_5
I:[5] Donald E. Knuth
S:Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.

*:G3_6
I:[6] Donald E. Knuth
S:Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs.
 :Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
 :let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
 :computer to do.

*:G3_7
I:[7] Donald E. Knuth
S:Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about,
 :the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at
 :efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and
 :maintenance are considered.  We should forget about small efficiencies, say
 :about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.  Yet
 :we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.

*:G3_8
I:[8] J. von Neumann
S:In mathematics you don't understand things.  You just get used to them.

*:G3_9
I:[9] Alan J. Perlis
S:I think that it's extraordinary important that we in computer science keep fun
 :in computing.  When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun.  Of course,
 :the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began
 :to take their complaints seriously.  We began to feel as if we really were
 :responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines.
 :I don't think we are.  I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting
 :them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house.  I hope the field
 :of computer science never loses its sense of fun.

*:G3_10
I:[10] Alan J. Perlis
S:It goes against the grain of modern education to teach students to program.
 :What fun is there to making plans, acquiring discipline, organizing thoughts,
 :devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self critical.

*:G3_11
I:[11] Alan J. Perlis
S:It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.

*:G3_12
I:[12] Alan J. Perlis
S:Optimization hinders evolution.  Everything should be built top-down, except the
 :first time.  Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

*:G3_13
I:[13] Alan J. Perlis
S:To understand a program, you must become both the machine and the program.

*:G3_14
I:[14] Bjarne Stroustrup
S:Design and programming are human activities; forget that and all is lost.

*:G3_15
I:[15] Alan Turing
S:We shall do much better programming job, provided we approach the task with
 :a full appreciation of its tremendous difficulty, provided that we respect
 :the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as very
 :humble programmers.

*:G3_16
I:[16] S. McConnell
S:Good code is its own best documentation.  As you're about to add a comment,
 :ask yourself "How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?"
 :Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.

*:G3_17
I:[17] Alan J. Perlis
S:A good programming language is a conceptual universe for thinking about
 :programming.

*:G3_18
I:[18] Alan J. Perlis
S:Fools ignore complexity; pragmatists suffer it; experts avoid it;
 :geniuses remove it.

*:G3_19
I:[19] Alan J. Perlis
S:I think it is inevitable that people program poorly.  Training will not
 :substantially help matters.  We have to learn to live with it.

*:G3_20
I:[20] E.B. White
S:The best writing is rewriting.

*:G3_21
I:[21] L. Wittenstein
S:The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

*:G3_22
I:[22] W. Wulf
S:More bugs have introduced into programs through premature optimization than
 :any other cause, including pure stupidity.
 :
 :(Sometimes quoted as:)
 :More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency, without 
 :necessarily achieving it, than for any other single reason - including
 :blind stupidity.

I:[23] E.C. Zeeman
S:Technical skill is mastery of complexity,

S:Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or
 :get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.

I:[27] Oscar Godson
S:One of the best programming skills you can have is knowing when to walk away

I:[28] Scott Adams
S:You can never underestimate the stupidity of the general public.

I:[29] Kreitzberg & Shmeiderman
S:Programming can be fun, so can cryptography;

*:G5_1
I:[1] Ron Jeffries
S:When we use a language, we should commit ourselves to knowing it, being able
 :to read it, and writing it idiomatically.

*:G5_2
I:[2] Steve McConnell
S:A brute force solution that works is better than an elegant solution that
 :doesn't work.

*:G5_3
I:[3] Alan J. Perlis
S:Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon, and other.

*:G5_4
I:[4] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our
 :thinking habits, and, therefore, on our thinking abilities.

*:G5_5
I:[5] Bjarne Stroustrup, "The Design and Evolution of C++"
S:There is no agreement of what a programming language really is
 :and what its main purpose is supposed to be.
 :
 :Is a programming language a tool for instructing machines?
 :A means of communicating between programmers?
 :A vehicle for expressing high-level designs?
 :A notation for algorithms?
 :A way of expressing relationships between concepts?
 :A tool for experimentation?
 :A means of controlling computerized devices?
 :
 :My view is that a general-purpose programming language must be all of those
 :to serve its diverse set of users.  The only thing a language cannot be
 :"and survive" is a mere collection of "neat" features.

*:G5_6
I:[6] Bjarne Stroustrup, "The Design and Evolution of C++"
S:It is my firm belief that all successful languages are grown and not merely
 :designed from first principles.

*:G5_7
I:[7] Bjarne Stroustrup, "The Design and Evolution of C++"
S:I have reaffirmed a long-standing and strongly held view: Language comparisons
 :are rarely meaningful and even less often fair.  A good comparison of major
 :programming languages requires more effort than most people are willing to
 :spend, experience in a wide range of application areas, a rigid maintenance
 :of a detached and impartial point of view, and a sense of fairness.

*:G5_8
I:[8] Bjarne Stroustrup, "LinuxWorld"
S:I think that any language that aspires to mainstream use must provide a broad
 :base for a variety of techniques -- including object-oriented programming
 :(class hierarchies) and generic programming (parameterized types and 
 :algorithms).  In particular, it must provide good facilities for composing
 :programs out of separate parts (possibly writing in several different
 :languages).  I also think that exceptions are necessary for managing the
 :complexity of error handling.  A language that lacks such facilities forces
 :its users to laboriously simulate them.

*:G5_9
I:[9] Dennis Ritchie, "LinuxWorld"
S:At least for the people who send me mail about a new language that they're
 :designing, the general advice is: do it to learn about how to write a compiler.
 :Don't have any expectations that anyone will use it, unless you hook up with
 :some sort of organization in a position to push it hard.  It's a lottery, and
 :some can buy a lot of the tickets.  There are plenty of beautiful languages
 :(more beautiful than C) that didn't catch on.  But someone does win the lottery,
 :and doing a language at least teaches you something.

*:G5_10
I:[10] Alan Kay, "Educom Review"
S:What doesn't exist are really powerful general forms of arguing with computers
 :right now.  So we have to have special orders coming in on special cases and
 :then think up ways to do it.  Some of these are generalizable and eventually you
 :will get an actual engineering discipline.

*:G5_11
I:[11] Abelson & Sussman, "SICP"
S:We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about languages and
 :program design.  This is the approach of stratified design, the notion that
 :a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described
 :using a sequence of languages.  Each level is constructed by combining parts
 :that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each
 :level are used as primitives at the next level.  The language used at each level
 :of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means of
 :abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.

*:G5_12
I:[12] Simon Peyton Jones
S:In the programming-language world, one rule of survival is simple: dance or die.
 :It is not enough to make a beautiful language.  You must also make it easy for
 :programs written in your beautiful language to interact with programs written in
 :other languages.

*:G5_13
I:[13] John McCarthy, "Towards a Mathematical Science of Computation"
S:Let me re-assert that the question of whether there are limitations in
 :principle of what problems man can make machines solve for him as compared
 :to his own ability to solve problems, really is a technical question in
 :recursive function theory.

I:[14] Kent Beck
S:The craft of programming begins with empathy, not formatting or languages or
 :tools or algorithms or data structures.

 :discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated.

S:The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether
 :submarines can swim.

*:G5_18
I:[18] Leonardo da Vinci
S:Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

*:G5_19
I:[19] Niklaus Wirth
S:Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which
 :is baffling -- the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.
 :Possibly this trend results from a mistaken belief that using a somewhat
 :mysterious device confers an aura of power on the user.

*:G5_20
I:[20] Chris Wenham
S:Debugging time increases as a square of the program's size.

*:G5_21
I:[21] P.J. Plauger
S:My definition of an expert in any field is a person who knows enough about
 :what's really going on to be scared.

*:G5_22
I:[22] Richard Gabriel
S:Old programs read like quiet conversations between a well-spoken research
 :worker and a well-studied mechanical colleague, not as a debate with a compiler.
 :Who'd have guessed sophistication bought such noise?

*:G5_23
I:[23] R. Buckminster Fuller
S:When I am working on a problem I never think about beauty.  I think only how to
 :solve the problem.  But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful,
 :I know it is wrong.

*:G5_24
I:[24] Linus Torvalds
S:I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good
 :one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important.
 :Bad programmers worry about the code.  Good programmers worry about data
 :structures and their relationships.

*:G5_27
I:[27] Hans Hoffmann
S:The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that
 :the necessary may speak.

*:G5_28
I:[28] John von Neumann
S:There's no sense being exact about something if you don't even know
 :what you're talking about.

*:G5_29
I:[29] Paul Graham
S:In programming the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding
 :what problems to solve.

*:G5_30
I:[30] Rob Pike
S:Such is modern computing: everything simple is made too complicated because
 :it's easy to fiddle with; everything complicated stays complicated because
 :it's hard to fix.

*:G5_31
I:[31] Christer Ericson
S:Premature optimization, that's like a sneeze.
 :Premature abstraction is like ebola; it makes my eyes bleed.

*:G5_32
I:[32] John Romero
S:You might not think programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely
 :creative profession.  It's logic-based creativity.

*:G5_33
I:[33] Ellen Ullman
S:Programming is the art of algorithm design and the craft of debugging
 :errant code.

*:G5_34
I:[34] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics;

*:G6_27
I:[27] Leslie Lamport
S:There is a race between the increasing complexity of the systems we build and our
 :ability to develop intellectual tools for understanding that complexity.  If the race

S:The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves
 :flowers and leaves.

*:PHIL_8
I:[8] Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace ("Ada Lovelace")
S:Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that because
 :the business of [Babbage's Analytical Engine] is to give its results in numerical
 :notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be arithmetical and
 :numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical.  This is an error.
 :
 :The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as if they
 :were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring out its
 :results in algebraic notation, were provisions made accordingly.

*:PHIL_9
I:[9] Gregory Bateson, "Mind and Nature"
S:Thirty years ago, we used to ask: Can a computer simulate all processes of logic?
 :The answer was "yes", but the question was surely wrong.  We should have asked:

*:PHIL_11

S:We're presently in the midst of third intellectual revolution.  The first came
 :with Newton: the planets obey physical laws.  The second came with Darwin: biology

S:It's always seemed like a big mystery how nature, seemingly so effortlessly,

S:Computation is not the same as thought and emulation is not the same as imagination.

*:PHIL_15
I:[15] Paul Graham
S:If you understand McCarthy's eval, you understand more than just a stage in the 
 :history of languages.  These ideas are still the semantic core of Lisp today.  
 :So studying McCarthy's original paper shows us, in a sense, what Lisp really is.  
 :It's not something that McCarthy designed so much as something he discovered.

*:PHIL_16
I:[16] Laura F. Landweber, "Evolution as Computation", Princeton 1999
S:It is now plausible at the molecular level to conceive of concerted, non-random
 :changes in the genome guided by cellular computing networks during episodes of

 :sophisticated information storage system, its evolution has become a matter of
 :highly sophisticated information processing.

*:PHIL_17
I:[17] Jaron Lanier, "Who Owns the Future?"
S:The reason Maxwell's Demon cannot exist is that it does take resources to perform
 :an act of discrimination.  We imagine computation is free, but it never is.  The 
 :very act of choosing which particle is cold or hot itself becomes an energy drain
 :and a source of waste heat.  The principle is also known as "no free lunch".
 :
 :We do our best to implement Maxwell's Demon whenever we manipulate reality with
 :our technologies, but we can never do so perfectly; we certainly can't get ahead
 :of the game, which is known as entropy.  All the air conditioners in a city emit
 :heat that makes the city hotter overall.  While you can implement what seems to be
 :a Maxwell's Demon if you don't look too far or too closely, in the big picture you
 :always lose more than you gain.
 :
 :Every bit in computer is a wannabe Maxwell's Demon, separting the state of "one"
 :from the state of "zero" for a while, at a cost.  A computer on a network can also
 :act like a wannabe demon if it tries to sort data from networked people into one
 :or the other side of some imaginary door, while pretending there is no cost or
 :risk involved.

*:PHIL_18
I:[18] Geoffrey Hinton
S:I have always been convinced that the only way to get artificial intelligence to

 :about how the brain actually works.

*:PHIL_19
I:[19] Howard Aiken
S:The desire to economize time and mental effort in arithmetical computations, and to
 :eliminate human liability to error is probably as old as the science of arithmetic
 :itself.

*:PHIL_20

S:A computation is a process that obeys finitely describable rules.

S:Some things, like the orbits of the planets, can be calculated far into the future.
 :But that's atypical.  In most contexts, there is a limit.  Even the most fine-

S:One of the things that I've been doing recently in my scientific research is to ask
 :this question: Is the universe actually capable of performing things like digital
 :computations?

*:PHIL_26
I:[26] Seth Lloyd
S:All physical systems can be thought of as registering and processing information,
 :and how one wishes to define computation will determine your view of what 
 :computation consists of.

*:PHIL_27
I:[27] Rudy Rucker
S:Lately I've been working to convince myself that everything is a computation.

*:PHIL_28
I:[28] Rudy Rucker
S:If you think of your life as a kind of computation, it's quite abundantly clear 
 :that there's not going to be a final answer and there won't be anything 
 :particularly wonderful about having the computation halt!

*:PHIL_29
I:[29] Rudy Rucker
S:If we suppose that many natural phenomena are in effect computations, the study of
 :computer science can tell us about the kinds of natural phenomena that can occur.

S:To me quantum computation is a new and deeper and better way to understand the laws
 :of physics, and hence understanding physical reality as a whole.

*:PHIL_31
I:[31] Steven Pinker
S:I spent 20 years doing research on regular and irregular verbs, not because I'm an
 :obsessive language lover but because it seemed to me that tey tapped into a
 :fundamental distinction in language processing, indeed in cognitive processing,
 :between memory lookup and rule-driven computation.

*:PHIL_32
I:[32] Edsger Dijkstra
S:Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

I:[33] Isaac Newton
S:Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and
 :confusion of things.

*:PHIL_34
I:[34] John A. Van de Walle
S:Mathematics is much more than computation with pencil and a paper and getting
 :answers to routine exercises.  In fact, it can easily be argued that computation,
 :such as doing long division, is not mathematics at all.  Calculators can do the
 :same thing and calculators can only calculate they cannot do mathematics.

*:PHIL_35
I:[35] L. Ron Hubbard
S:Imagination is actually a form of computation.  Imagination gives calculated and
 :instinctive solutions for the future.

*:PHIL_36
I:[36] Leonard Adleman
S:Biology and computer science - life and computation - are related.  I am confident
 :that at their interface great discoveries await those who seek them.

*:PHIL_37
I:[37] Seth Lloyd
S:We couldn't build quantum computers unless the universe were quantum and computing.
 :We can build such machines because the universe is storing and processing
 :information in the quantum realm.  When we build quantum computers, we're hijacking
 :that underlying computation in order to make it do things we want: little and/or/not
 :calculations.  We're hacking into the universe.

S:At the present time there exist problems beyond our ability to solve, not because
 :of theoretical difficulties, but because of insufficient means of mechanical 
 :computation.

S:Computation involves going from a question to an answer.
 :Mathematics involves going from an answer to a question.

B:Philosophical Thoughts: Man, Mind, Machine, etc. #2

*:PHIL2_1
I:[1] Charles Babbage
S:On two occasions I have been asked: "If you put into the machine wrong figures, 
 :will the right answers come out?"
 :
 :I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could 
 :provoke such a question.

*:PHIL2_2
I:[2] Stephen Hawking
S:I think computer viruses should count as life.  I think it says something about
 :human nature that the only form of life we have created is purely destructive.
 :We've created life in our own image.

*:PHIL2_3
I:[3] Arthur C. Clarke, "2010: Odyssey Two"
S:Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference;
 :we should each be treated with appropriate respect.

*:PHIL2_4
I:[4] Jaron Lanier, "You Are Not a Gadget"
S:Emphasizing the crowd means de-emphasizing individual humans in the design of
 :society, and when you ask people not to be people, they revert to bad, mob-like
 :behaviors.

*:PHIL2_5
I:[5] Steve Wozniak
S:"All of a sudden, we've lost a lot of controls," he said.  "We can't turn off
 :our internet; we can't turn off our smartphones; we can't turn off our computers.
 :You used to ask a smart person a question.  Now, who do you ask? It starts with
 :g-o, and it's not God..."

*:PHIL2_6
I:[6] Michael Crichton, "The Terminal Man"
S:... we have created a man with not one brain but two.  This new brain is intended
 :to control the biological brain.  The patient's biological brain is the peripheral
 :terminal -- the only peripheral terminal -- for the new computer.  And therefore
 :the patient's brain, indeed his whole body, has become a terminal for the new
 :computer.  We have created a man who is one single, large, complex computer
 :terminal.  The patient is a read-out device for the new computer, and is helpless
 :to control the readout as a TV screen is helpless to control the information
 :presented on it.

*:PHIL2_7
I:[7] Veronica Roth, "Divergent"
S:Two things you should know about me; The first is that I am deeply suspicious of
 :people in general.  It is my nature to expect the worst of them.  

*:PHIL2_8
I:[8] Richard Dawkins
S:Personally, I rather look forward to a computer program wining the world chess
 :championship.  Humanity needs a lesson in humility.

*:PHIL2_9
I:[9] Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.
S:Computers are magnificent tools for the realization of our dreams, but no machine
 :can replace the human spark of spirit, compassion, love, and understanding.

*:PHIL2_10
I:[10] Sydney J. Harris
S:The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men
 :will begin to think like computers.

*:PHIL2_11
I:[11] Adam Osborne
S:The future lies in designing and selling computers that people don't realize
 :are computers at all.

*:PHIL2_12
I:[12] Alan Kay
S:Computer science inverts the normal.  In normal science, you're given a world,
 :and your job is to find out the rules.  In computer science, you give the 
 :computer the rules, and it creates the world.

*:PHIL2_13
I:[13] Paul Allen
S:The promise of artificial intelligence and computer science generally vastly
 :outweighs the impact it could have on some jobs in the same way that, while the
 :invention of the airplane negatively affected the railroad industry, it opened
 :a much wider door to human to progress.

*:PHIL2_14
I:[14] Isaac Asimov, "Robot Visions"
S:In a properly automated and educated world, then, machines may prove to be the
 :true humanizing influence.  It may be that machines will do the work that makes
 :life possible and that human beings will do all the other things that make life
 :pleasant and worthwhile.

*:PHIL2_15
I:[15] William S. Burroughs
S:The study of thinking machines teaches us more about the brain than we can learn
 :by introspective methods.  Western man is externalizing himself in the form of
 :gadgets.

*:PHIL2_16
I:[16] Alan Turing, "Mechanical Intelligence: Collected Works of A.M. Turing"
S:The original question, 'Can machines think?' I believe to be too meaningless
 :to deserve discussion.

*:PHIL2_17
I:[17] Douglas Rushkoff, "Program or Be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age"
S:We are looking at a society increasingly dependent on machines, yet decreasingly
 :capable of making or even using them effectively.

*:PHIL2_18
I:[18] Bill Watterson, "There's Treasure Everywhere"
S:We don't value craftsmanship anymore! All we value is ruthless efficiency, and
 :I say we deny our own humanity that way! Without appreciation for grace and
 :beauty, there's no pleasure in creating things and no pleasure in having them!
 :
 :Our lives are made drearier, rather than richer! How can a person take pride
 :in his work when skill and care are considered luxuries! We're not machines!
 :We have a human need for craftsmanship.

*:PHIL2_19
I:[19] Hugo Cabret (Fictional Character)
S:I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine.  Machines never come with any
 :extra parts, you know.  They always come with the exact amount they need.  So I
 :figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part.
 :I had to be here for some reason.  And that means you have to be here for some
 :reason, too.

*:PHIL2_20
I:[20] Adrian Tchaikovsky, "Blood of the Mantis"
S:Progress is made by the improvement of people, not the improvement of machines.

*:PHIL2_21
I:[21] Louise Gluck, "The Wild Iris"
S:Go ahead: say what you're thinking. 
 :The garden is not the real world.
 :Machines are the real world.

*:PHIL2_22
I:[22] Kurt Vonnegut, "Breakfast of Champions"
S:So, in the interests of survival, they trained themselves to be agreeing machines
 :instead of thinking machines.  All their minds had to do was to discover what
 :other people were thinking, and then they thought that, too.

*:PHIL2_23
I:[23] Kai-Fu Lee
S:Part of why predicting the ending to our artificial intelligence story is so
 :difficult is because this isn't just a story about machines.  It's also a story
 :about human beings, people with free wills that allows them to make their own
 :choices and to shape their own destinies.  Our AI future will be created by us,
 :and it will reflect the choices we make and the actions we take.

*:PHIL2_24
I:[24] E.M. Forster, "The Machine Stops"
S:Cannot you see, cannot you all lecturers see, that it is we that are dying and
 :that down here the only thing that really lives is the Machine?
 :
 :We created the Machine, to do our will, but we cannot make it do our will now.
 :It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch, it has blurred
 :every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act, it has paralysed
 :our bodies and our wills, and now it compels us to worship it.  The Machine
 :develops -- but not on our lines.  The Machine proceeds -- but not to our goal.
 :We only exist as the blood corpuscles that course through its arteries, and if
 :it could work without us, it would let us die.

*:PHIL2_25
I:[25] Steve Toutonghi, "Side Life"
S:The machines of the mind are more difficult to recognize than machines of
 :iron and steam.

*:PHIL2_26
I:[26] Dahi Tamara Koch, "Within the event horizon: Poetry prose"
S:Emotions make us human.  Without being able to feel something, we cannot be
 :anything more than machines.

*:PHIL2_27
I:[27] Richie Norton
S:The industrial model is gone.  People are more than machines.

*:PHIL2_28
I:[28] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:The goal of this book is to highlight the computational beauty found in
 :nature's program.

*:PHIL2_29
I:[29] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:Reductionism is a powerful way of looking at the universe.  But this begs a
 :somewhat silly question: Since everything ultimately breaks down to the quantum
 :level, why aren't all scientists mathematicians at the core? In such a world
 :physicians would make diagnoses based on the patient's bodily quarks, which
 :makes about as much sense as building a house particle by particle.  Neverthe-
 :less, every scientist must possess some knowledge of the level one step more
 :fundamental than his or her specialty, but at some point reductionism must stop
 :for science to be effective.

*:PHIL2_30
I:[30] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:Now, suppose that we wished to describe how the universe works.  We could take
 :a reductionist's approach and catalog all the different types of objects that
 :exist -- perhaps starting with galaxy clusters, hitting terrestrial life forms
 :about midway through, and then ending with subatomic particles -- but would this
 :approach rally succeed in describing the universe?
 :
 :In making a large list of "things" it is easy to forget that the manner in which
 :"things" work more often than not depends on the environment in which they exist.
 :For example, we could describe the form of a duck in excruciating detail, but
 :this gives us only half of the story.  To really appreciate what a duck is, we
 :should look at ducks in the air, in water, in the context of what they eat and
 :what eats them, how they court, mate, and reproduce, the social structures they
 :form, how they flock, and their need to migrate.

*:PHIL2_31
I:[31] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:Looking back at the organization of sciences, we find that at each level of
 :understanding, traditional scientists study two types of phenomena: agents
 :(molecules, cells, ducks, and species) and interactions of agents (chemical
 :reactions, immune system responses, duck mating, and evolution).
 :
 :Studying agents in isolation is a fruitful way of discovering insights into
 :the form and function of an agent, but doing so has some known limitations.
 :Specifically, reductionism fails when we try to use it in a reverse direction.
 :As we shall see throughout this book, having a complete and perfect under-
 :standing of how an agent behaves in no way guarantees that you will be able
 :to predict how this single agent will behave for all time or in the context
 :of other agents.

*:PHIL2_32
I:[32] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:We have, then, three different ways of looking at how things work.  We can
 :take a purely reductionist approach and attempt to understand things through
 :dissection.  We also can take a wider view and attempt to understand whole
 :collections at once by observing how many agents, say the neurons in a brain,
 :form a global pattern, such as human intelligence.  Or we can take an inter-
 :mediate view and focus attention on the interactions of agents.  Through
 :this middle path, the interactions of agents can be seen to form the glue that
 :binds one level of understanding to the next level.

*:PHIL2_33
I:[33] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:Any discrete piece of information can be represented by a set of numbers.
 :Systems that compute can represent powerful mappings from one set of numbers
 :to another.  Moreoever, any program on any computer is equivalent to a number
 :mapping.  These mappings can be thought of as statements about the properties
 :of numbers; hence, there is a close connection between computer programs and
 :mathematical proofs.

*:PHIL2_34
I:[34] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:[Cont] But there are more possible mappings than possible programs; thus, there
 :are some things that simply cannot be computed.  The actual process of computing
 :can be defined in terms of a very small number of primitive operations, with
 :recursion and/or iteratiion comprising the most fundamental pieces of a computing
 :device.  Computing devices can also make statements about other computing devices.
 :This leads to a fundamental paradox that ultimately exposes the limitations not
 :just of machine logic, but all of nature as well.

*:PHIL2_35
I:[35] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:Later Turing proved that Turing machines could compute exactly the same functions
 :as lambda calculus, which proved that all three models of computation are equi-
 :valent.  This is a truly remarkable result, considering how different the three
 :models of computation are.  In Church's 1941 paper he made a statement that is
 :now known as the Church-Turing thesis:
 :
 :Any function that can be called computable can be comuted by lambda calculus,
 :a Turing machine, or a general recursive function.

*:PHIL2_36
I:[36] Gary William Flake, "The Computational Beauty of Nature"
S:[Cont] Recall the point that was made about functions describing relationships
 :between numbers and models of computation describing functions.  Well, the
 :Church-Turing thesis is yet another level more fundamental than a model of
 :computation.  As a statement about models of computation, it is not subject to
 :proof in the usual sense; thus, it is impossible to prove that the thesis is
 :correct.
 :
 :One could disprove it by coming up with a model of computation over discrete
 :elements that could calculate things that one of the other models could not;
 :however, this has not happened.  The fact that every posed model of computation
 :has always been exactly equivalent to (or weaker than) one of the others lend
 :strong support to the Church-Turing thesis.

I:[18] Richard P. Gabriel & Ron Goldman, "Mob Software: The Erotic Life of Code"
S:Software development methodologies evolved under this regime [figure it out,

 :master planning.  Such beliefs were rooted in an elementary-school-level
 :fiction that great masterpieces were planned, or arose as a by-product of

*:SW2_19
I:[19] Kent Beck, "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns"
S:To me, development consists of two processes that feed each other.  First,
 :you figure out what you want the computer to do.  Then, you instruct the
 :computer to do it.  Trying to write those instructions inevitably changes
 :what you want the computer to do and so it goes.
 :
 :In this model, coding isn't the poor handmaiden of design or analysis.
 :Coding is where your fuzzy, comfortable ideas awaken in the harsh domain of
 :reality.  It is where you learn what your computer can do.  If you stop
 :coding, you stop learning.
 :
 :We aren't always good at guessing where responsibilities should go.  Coding
 :is where our design guesses are tested.  Being prepared to be flexible about
 :making design changes during coding results in programs that get better and
 :better over time.  Insisting that early ideas be carried through is short
 :sighted.

*:SW2_20
I:[20] Paul Graham, "ANSI Common Lisp"
S:Planning is necessary evil.  It is a response to risk: the more dangerous an
 :undertaking, the more important it is to plan ahead.  Powerful tools decrease
 :risk, and so decrease the need for planning.  The design of your program can
 :then benefit from what is probably the most useful source of information
 :available: the experience of implementing it.

I:[21] Boris Beizer, "Software Testing Techniques" 2E. 1990.
S:Software quality has almost nothing to do with algorithmic elegance, compact-

I:[16] Edmond Lau, "The Effective Engineer"
S:In his book, Software Abstractions, MIT Professor Daniel Jackson explains just

I:[17] Piethein Strengholt
S:Connascence, in the context of software engineering, refers to the degree of

 :the overall correctness of the system.

*:SW3_18
I:[18] Laurent Bossavit, "The Leprechauns of Software Engineering"
S:A lot of research in software engineering strikes me as hopelessly naive in
 :one or two ways.  Most of it fails entirely to account for the social and
 :belief aspects altogether.  It looks at its object of inquiry as if it was
 :entirely material and inert; as if "software" was some kind of naturally
 :occurring substance, the properties of which can be revealed in the equivalent
 :of a test tube.

*:SW3_19
I:[19] Dominica Degrandis, "Making Work Visible"
S:Businesses frequently prioritize new feature releases over fixing technical
 :debt.  They choose to work on revenue-generating work instead of revenue-
 :protection work.  This rarely works out as the business hopes, particularly
 :as problems discovered during the final stages of uncompleted projects drag
 :engineers away from the newer projects.

*:SW3_20
I:[20] Niklaus Wirth
S:The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and programmers is
 :wrong.  A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to a
 :significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not

*:SW3_21

S:Conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.

*:SW3_26

 :quantity problem; we have a quality problem.  One bad programmer can easily
 :create two new jobs a year.  Hiring more bad programmers will just increase

*:OPTMZ_1
B:Concerning Performance, Speed, and Optimization  

*:OTM_1
I:[1] Donald E. Knuth
S:Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about,
 :the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at
 :efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and
 :maintenance are considered.  We should forget about small efficiencies, say
 :about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.  Yet
 :we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.

*:OTM_2
I:[2] W. Wulf
S:More bugs have introduced into programs through premature optimization than
 :any other cause, including pure stupidity.
 :
 :(Sometimes quoted as:)
 :More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency, without 
 :necessarily achieving it, than for any other single reason - including blind
 :stupidity.

*:OTM_3
I:[3] Donald E. Knuth
S:You're bound to be unhappy if you optimize everything.

*:OTM_4
I:[4] Steve McConnell
S:The big optimizations come from refining the high-level design, not the
 :individual routines.

*:OTM_5
I:[5] Christer Ericson
S:Premature optimization, that's like a sneeze.
 :Premature abstraction is like ebola; it makes my eyes bleed.

*:OTM_6
I:[6] Elements of Programming Style, Kernighan & Plauger
S:Let your compiler do the simple optimizations.

*:OTM_7
I:[7] The Art of Unix Programming, Eric Raymond
S:Rule of Optimization:
 :Prototype before polishing.  Get it working before you optimize it.

*:OTM_8
I:[8] The Art of Unix Programming, Eric Raymond
S:Rushing to optimize before the bottlenecks are known may be the only error to
 :have ruined more designs than feature creep.  From tortured code to incomprehen-
 :sible data layouts, the results of obsessing about speed or memory or disk usage
 :at the expense of transparency and simplicity are everywhere.  They spawn
 :innumerable bugs and cost millions of man-hours—often, just to get marginal
 :gains in the use of some resource much less expensive than debugging time.
 :Disturbingly often, premature local optimization actually hinders global
 :optimization (and hence reduces overall performance).  A prematurely optimized
 :portion of a design frequently interferes with changes that would have much
 :higher payoffs across the whole design, so you end up with both inferior
 :performance and excessively complex code.

*:OTM_9
I:[9] Peter Gabriel
S:The very architecture of almost every computer today is designed to optimize
 :the performance of Fortran programs and its operating-system-level sister, C.

*:OTM_10
I:[10] D. Jones
S:The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast
 :and much easier to understand.

S:The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state
 :to the working state.

I:[19] Elements of Programming Style, Kernighan & Plauger
S:Instrument your programs.  Measure before making efficiency changes.

*:OTM_20
I:[20] S. Heller, in "Efficient C/C++ Programming"
S:The speed of a non-working program is irrelevant.

*:OTM_21
I:[21] Boris Beizer, "Software Testing Techniques" 2E. 1990.
S:Software quality has almost nothing to do with algorithmic elegance, compact-
 :ness, or speed - in fact, those attributes do more harm to quality than good.

*:OTM_22
I:[22] Donald E. Knuth, "Selected Papers on Computer Science"
S:The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform
 :them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly.
 :A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic
 :and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate
 :the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results
 :will be correct.

*:OTM_23
I:[23] D. Gelernter, "Machine Beauty"
S:Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because
 :software is so complicated.  Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity.
 :The geniuses of the computer field, on the other hand, are the people with
 :keenest aesthetic senses, the ones who are capable of creating beauty.  Beauty
 :is decisive at every level: the most important interfaces, the most important
 :programming languages, the winning algorithms are the beautiful ones.
 
*:OTM_24
I:[24] Alan J. Perlis
S:Optimization hinders evolution.  Everything should be built top-down, except the
 :first time.  Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

*:OTM_25
I:[25] William A. Dembski
S:Constrained optimization is the art of compromise between conflicting objectives.
 :This is what design is all about.  To find fault with biological design - as
 :Stephen Jay Gould regularly does - because it misses some idealized optimum is
 :therefore gratuitous.  Not knowing the objectives of the designer, Gould is in no
 :position to say whether the designer has proposed a faulty compromise among those
 :objectives.

*:OTM_26
I:[26] Larry Constantine
S:In fast moving markets, adaptation is significantly more important
 :than optimization.

*:OTM_27
I:[27] Rob Pike
S:Caches aren't architecture, they're just optimization.

*:OTM_28

 :For comments that are not preserved during parsing, # is the conventional start
 :character.

I:[26] 
S:Transparency is therefore more than an esthetic triumph; it is a victory that
 :will be reflected in lower costs throughout the software's life cycle.

*:UNIX_27
I:[27] 
S:Top-down tends to be good practice when three preconditions are true:
 :(a) you can specify in advance precisely what the program is to do,
 :(b) the specification is unlikely to change significantly during implementation,
 :and (c) you have a lot of freedom in choosing, at a low level, how the program
 :is to get that job done.

*:UNIX_28
I:(28)
S:There is a flip side to this.  In the Unix world, libraries which are delivered
 :as libraries should come with exerciser programs.

*:UNIX_29
I:[29]
S:When you see the right thing, do it — this may look like more work in the short
 :term, but it's the path of least effort in the long run.  If you don't know
 :what the right thing is, do the minimum necessary to get the job done, at
 :least until you figure out what the right thing is.
 :
 :To do the Unix philosophy right, you have to be loyal to excellence.
 :You have to believe that software design is a craft worth all the intelligence,
 :creativity, and passion you can muster.  Otherwise you won't look past the easy,
 :stereotyped ways of approaching design and implementation; you'll rush into
 :coding when you should be thinking.  You'll carelessly complicate when you
 :should be relentlessly simplifying—and then you'll wonder why your code bloats
 :and debugging is so hard.

*:UNIX_30
I:[30]
S:If you have any trouble sounding condescending, find a Unix user to show you
 :how it's done.

*:UNIX_31
I:[31]
S:As with buildings, it's easier to repair superstructure on top of a solid
 :foundation than it is to replace the foundations without trashing the
 :superstructure.

*:UNIX_32
I:[32]
S:Make each program do one thing well.  To do a new job, build afresh rather
 :than complicate old programs by adding new features.

*:UNIX_33
I:[33]
S:The nightmare scenario is one in which corporate monopolism and statist
 :power-seeking, always natural allies, feed back into each other and create
 :rationales for increasing regulation, repression, and criminalization of
 :digital speech.

*:UNIX_34
I:[34]
S:To design for compactness and orthogonality, start from zero.
 :Zen teaches that attachment leads to suffering; experience with software
 :design teaches that attachment to unnoticed assumptions leads to
 :non-orthogonality, noncompact designs, and projects that fail or become
 :maintenance nightmares.

*:UNIX_35
I:[35]
S:Web pages get bogged down in the dispute over whether the reader or author
 :should control the appearance.

*:UNIX_36
I:[36]
S:To design the perfect anti-Unix, write an operating system that thinks it knows
 :what you're doing better than you do.  And then adds injury to insult by getting
 :it wrong.

*:UNIX_37
I:[37]
S:One of the main lessons of Zen is that we ordinarily see the world through
 :a haze of preconceptions and fixed ideas that proceed from our desires.
 :To achieve enlightenment, we must follow the Zen teaching not merely to let go
 :of desire and attachment, but to experience reality exactly as it is —- without
 :the preconceptions and the fixed ideas getting in the way.

*:UNIX_38
I:[38]
S:Tools that look glossy but shatter under stress are not good long-term value.

*:UNIX_39
I:[39]
S:Rushing to optimize before the bottlenecks are known may be the only error to
 :have ruined more designs than feature creep.  From tortured code to incomprehen-
 :sible data layouts, the results of obsessing about speed or memory or disk usage
 :at the expense of transparency and simplicity are everywhere.  They spawn
 :innumerable bugs and cost millions of man-hours—often, just to get marginal
 :gains in the use of some resource much less expensive than debugging time.
 :Disturbingly often, premature local optimization actually hinders global
 :optimization (and hence reduces overall performance).  A prematurely optimized
 :portion of a design frequently interferes with changes that would have much
 :higher payoffs across the whole design, so you end up with both inferior
 :performance and excessively complex code.

*:UNIX_40
I:[40]
S:Mixing languages is better than writing everything in one, if and only if
 :using only that one is likely to overcomplicate the program.

*:UNIX_41
I:[41]
S:Are the individual functions in your modules too large? 
 :
 :This is not so much a matter of line count as it is of internal complexity.
 :If you can't informally describe a function's contract with its callers in
 :one line, the function is probably too large.
 :
 :Many years ago, I learned from Kernighan & Plauger's "The Elements of
 :Programming Style" a useful rule.  Write that one-line comment immediately
 :after the prototype of your function.  For every function, without exception.

B:Quotes on Lisp and Functional Programming Languages

*:L1_1
I:[1] Marvin Minsky
S:Anyone could learn Lisp in one day, except that if they
 :already knew Fortran, it would take three days.

*:L1_2
I:[2] John Fraser
S:Lisp is the red pill.

*:L1_3
I:[3] Alan Kay, on Lisp
S:The greatest single programming language ever designed.

*:L1_4
I:[4] Douglas Hofstadter, "Godel, Escher, Bach"
S:One of the most important and fascinating of all computer
 :languages is Lisp (standing for "List Processing"), which was
 :invented by John McCarthy around the time Algol was invented.

*:L1_5
I:[5] John Foderaro, CACM, September 1991
S:Lisp is a programmable programming language.

*:L1_6
I:[6] John McCarthy, "Early History of Lisp"
S:One can even conjecture that Lisp owes its survival
 :specifically to the fact that its programs are lists, which
 :everyone, including me, has regarded as a disadvantage.

*:L1_7
I:[7] Alan Kay
S:Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material.

*:L1_8
I:[8] Philip Greenspun
S:Greenspun's Tenth Rule of Programming: 
 :Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc
 :informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

*:L1_9
I:[9] Eric Raymond, "How to Become a Hacker"
S:Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment
 :experience you will have when you finally get it; That
 :experience will make you a better programmer for the rest
 :of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.

*:L1_10
I:[10] Yukihiro 'Matz' Matsumoto, LL2
S:Some may say Ruby is a bad rip-off of Lisp or Smalltalk,
 :and I admit that.  But it is nicer to ordinary people.

*:L1_11
I:[11] Guy Steele, Java spec co-author
S:We were not to win over the Lisp programmers;
 :we were after the C++ programmers.  We managed to drag
 :a lot of them about halfway to Lisp.

*:L1_12
I:[12] Edsger Dijkstra, CACM, 15:10
S:Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to
 :misuse a computer".  I think that description is a great
 :compliment because it transmits the full flavor of liberation:
 :it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans
 :in thinking previously impossible thoughts.

*:L1_13
I:[13] Martin Rodgers (first said by Chuck Moore about Forth)
S:Lisp is a programmer amplifier.

*:L1_14
I:[14] L. Peter Deutsch
S:Lisp... made me aware that software could be close to executable mathematics.

*:L1_15
I:[15] Winston & Horn, "Lisp"
S:Common Lisp, a happy amalgam of the features of previous Lisps.

*:L1_16
I:[16] Scott Fahlman
S:Common Lisp is politics, not art.

*:L1_17
I:[17] Eric Raymond, in "Open Sources" on MIT's first OS, ITS
S:Lisp was far more powerful and flexible than any other language of its day;
 :in fact, it is still a better design than most languages of today,
 :twenty-five years later.  Lisp freed ITS's hackers to think in unusual
 :and creative ways.  It was a major factor in their success, and remains
 :one of hackerdom's favorite languages.

*:L1_18
I:[18] Philip Greenspun
S:SQL, Lisp, and Haskell are the only languages that I've seen
 :where one spends more time thinking than typing.

*:L1_19
I:[19] A guy on Slashdot. What theory fits this data?
S:I have heard more than one Lisp advocate state such subjective comments as,
 :"Lisp is the most powerful and elegant programming language in the world"
 :and expect such comments to be taken as objective truth.  I had never
 :heard a Java, C++, C, Perl, or Python advocate make the same claim about
 :their own language of choice.

*:L1_20
I:[20] Robert Floyd, Turing Award Lecture, 1979
S:Although my own previous enthusiasm has been for syntactically rich languages,
 :like the Algol family, I now see clearly and concretely the force of Minsky's
 :1970 Turing Lecture, in which he argued that Lisp's uniformity of structure
 :and power of self reference gave the programmer capabilities whose content
 :was well worth the sacrifice of visual form.

*:L1_21
I:[21] Michael Feathers
S:Object oriented programming makes code understandable by encapsulating moving
 :parts.  Functional programming makes code understandable by minimizing moving
 :parts.

*:L1_22
I:[22] Audrey Tang
S:Haskell is faster than C++, more concise than Perl, more regular than Python,
 :more flexible than Ruby, more typeful than C#, more robust than Java, and has
 :absolutely nothing in common with PHP.

*:L1_23
I:[23] Peter Seibel
S:Consequently, a Common Lisp program tends to provide a much clearer mapping
 :between your ideas about how the program works and the code you actually write.
 :Your ideas aren't obscured by boilerplate code and endlessly repeated idioms.
 :This makes your code easier to maintain because you don't have to wade through
 :reams of code every time you need to make a change.

*:L1_24
I:[24] Simon Thompson, "Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming"
S:Haskell programs are easy to parallelize, and to run efficiently on multicore
 :hardware, because there is no state to be shared between different threads.

*:L1_25
I:[25] Robert C. Martin
S:You don't need semaphores if you don't have side effects! You can't have
 :concurrent update problems if you don't update!
 :So that's the big deal about functional languages; and it is one big fricking
 :deal.  There is a freight train barreling down the tracks towards us, with
 :multi-core emblazoned on it; and you'd better be ready by the time it gets here.

*:L1_26
I:[26] John Carmack
S:Programming in a functional style makes the state presented to your code
 :explicit, which makes it much easier to reason about, and, in a completely
 :pure system, makes thread race conditions impossible.

*:L1_27
I:[27] Joe Armstrong, "Programming Erlang"
S:Processes share no data with other processes.  This is the reason why we can
 :easily distribute Erlang programs over multicores or networks.

*:L1_28
I:[28] Martin Odersky
S:non-determinism = parallel processing + mutable state

*:L1_29
I:[29] Wikipedia
S:In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm -
 :a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs -
 :that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids
 :changing-state and mutable data.
 :
 :(By contrast) Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses
 :statements that change a program's state.

*:L1_30
I:[30] Marry Rose Cook, "A Practical Introduction to Functional Programming (article)"
S:When people talk about functional programming, they mention a dizzying number
 :of 'functional' characteristics.  They mention immutable data, first class
 :functions, and tail call optimisation.  These are language features that aid
 :functional programming.

*:L1_31
I:[31] Marry Rose Cook, continue from previous
S:(Continue) They mention mapping, reducing, pipelining, recursing, currying and
 :the use of higher order functions.  These are programming techniques used to
 :write functional code.
 :
 :They mention parallelization, lazy evaluation, and determinism.  These are
 :advantageous properties of functional programs.

*:L1_32
I:[32] Marry Rose Cook, continue from previous
S:(Continue) Ignore all that.  Functional code is characterised by one thing:
 :the absence of side effects.  It (a pure function) doesn't rely on data outside
 :the current function, and it doesn't change data that exists outside the
 :current function.  Every other 'functional' thing can be derived from this
 :property.  Use it as a guide rope as you learn.”

*:L2_1
I:[1] Paul Graham, Nov 1983

*:L2_2
I:[2] Found on com.lang.lisp
S:Will write code that writes code that writes code for money.

S:Lisp is a language for doing what you've been told is impossible.

S:Within a couple weeks of learning Lisp I found programming in any other
 :language unbearably constraining.

*:L2_5
I:[5] Paul Graham
S:Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been bad:
 :Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++.  The good languages have been those that
 :were designed for their own creators: C, Perl, Smalltalk, Lisp.

S:Programming in Lisp is like playing with the primodial forces of the universe.
 :It feels like lightning between your fingertips.  No other language even 
 :feels close.

*:L2_7
I:[7] Svein Ove Aas
S:The language God would have used to implement the Universe.

*:L2_8
I:[8] Christian Lynbech
S:Lisp is the most sophisticated programming language I know.  It is literally
 :decades ahead of the competition ... it is not possible (as far as I know)
 :to actually use Lisp seriously before reaching the point of no return.

*:L2_9
I:[9] Alan Kay
S:I finally understood that half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the
 :Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself.  These were "Maxwell's Equations of
 :Software!".

*:L2_10
I:[10] Larry Wall
S:Lisp has all the visual appeal of oatmeal with fingernail clippings mixed in.
 :(Other than that, it's quite a nice language).

*:L2_11
I:[11] Alan Perlis, in foreward of SICP
S:Pascal is for building pyramids -- imposing, breathtaking, static structures
 :built by armies pushing heavy blocks into places.  Lisp is for building 
 :organisms -- imposing, breaktaking, dynamic structures built by squads
 :fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place.

*:L2_12
I:[12] Richard Stallman
S:The most powerful programming language is Lisp.  If you don't know Lisp (or its
 :variant, Scheme), you don't appreciate what a powerful language is.  Once you
 :learn Lisp you will see what is missing in most other languages.

*:L2_13
I:[13] Larry Wall
S:By policy, Lisp has never really catered to mere mortals.  And, of course,
 :mere mortals have never really forgiven Lisp for not catering to them.

*:L2_14
I:[14] Joel Moses
S:APL is like a beautiful diamond - flawless, beautifully symmetrical.
 :But you can't add anything to it.  If you try to glue on another diamond,
 :you don't get a bigger diamond.  Lisp is like a ball of mud.  Add more
 :and it's still a ball of mud - it's still looks like Lisp.

*:L2_15
I:[15] Erik Naggum
S:Common Lisp people seem to behave in a way that is akin to the Borg:
 :they study the various new things that people do with interest and then
 :find that it was eminently doable in Common Lisp all along and they can
 :use these new techniques if they think they need them.

*:L2_16
I:[16] Alan Perlis
S:A Lisp programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

*:L2_17
I:[17] amz
S:If programming languages were religions ...
 :
 :Lisp would be Zen Buddhism - There is no syntax, there is no centralization
 :of dogma, there are no deities to worship.  The entire universe is there at
 :your reach - if only you are enlightened enough to grasp it.  Some say that
 :it's not a language at all; others say that it's the only language that
 :make sense.

*:L2_18
I:[18] Anonymous
S:LISP stands for: Lots of Insane Stupid Parentheses.
 :LISP stands for: Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses.

*:L2_19
I:[19] Peter Norvig
S:In Lisp, if you want to do aspect-oriented programming, you just do a
 :bunch of macros and you're there.  In Java, you have to get Gregor Kiczales
 :to go out and start a new company, taking months and years and try to get
 :that to work.  Lisp still has the advantage there, it's just a question
 :of people wanting that.

*:L2_20
I:[20] Paul Graham
S:The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous was the
 :company.  The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience.  You
 :never had to worry about those.  You were also safe if they said they wanted
 :C++ or Java developers.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would
 :be a bit frightening.  If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp
 :hackers, I would have been really worried.

*:L2_21
I:[21] Paul Graham, "ANSI Common Lisp"
S:The spirit of Lisp hacking can be expressed in two sentences.
 :Programming should be fun.  Programs should be beautiful.

*:L2_22
I:[22] Philip Wadler, "How to declare an imperative"
S:Whereas some declarative programmers only pay lip service to equational
 :reasoning, users of functional languages exploit them every time they run a
 :compiler, whether they notice it or not.

*:L2_23
I:[23] Robin Milner
S:There are many ways of trying to understand programs.  People often rely too
 :much on one way, which is called 'debugging' and consists of running a
 :partly-understood program to see if it does what you expected.  Another way,
 :which ML advocates, is to install some means of understanding in the very
 :programs themselves.

*:L2_24
I:[24] Alvin Alexander
S:The best FP code is like algebra, and in algebra you never re-use variables.
 :And not re-using variables has many benefits.

*:L2_25
I:[25] Bartos Milewski
S:Did you notice that in the definition of 'data race'
 :there's always talk of mutation?

*:L2_26
I:[26] defmacro
S:A functional program is ready for concurrency without any further modifications.
 :You never have to worry about deadlocks and race conditions because you don't
 :need to use locks.  No piece of data in a functional program is modified twice
 :by the same thread, let alone by two different threads.  That means you can
 :easily add threads without ever giving conventional problems that plague
 :concurrency applications a second thought.

*:L2_27
I:[27] Jon Fairbairn
S:By the way seriously: how do you debug Haskell programs?
 :
 :Mostly seriously: I don't.  If the programme doesn't work the way I intended it,
 :I rewrite bits in a simpler fashion until I understand it well enough and it
 :works.  For the sort of programme you were asking for, breaking things up until
 :they are small enough that one can understand the individual parts completely
 :(as I did in the solution I posted) and then composing them together really is
 :the best approach.
 :
 :If you need to debug a programme that simple, what it's telling you is that
 :you've written it the wrong way!

*:L2_28
I:[28] Audrey Tang
S:I think Haskell excels at everything but user base :)

*:L2_29
I:[29] Audrey Tang
S:Perl: "Easy things are easy, hard things are possible."
 :Haskell: "Hard things are easy, the impossible just happened."

*:L2_30
I:[30] Collection of "Shoot Yourself in the Foot with Haskell"
S:You shoot the gun, but the bullet gets trapped in the IO monad.
 :
 :Couldn't match expected type 'Deer' against inferred type 'Foot'.
 :
 :The bullet is in the ST monad and the gun is in the IO monad, so you can't.
 :
 :You are perfectly fine as long as you just don't evaluate the foot.
 :
 :Nothing happens unless you start walking.

*:L2_31
I:[31] Stephen Wolfram
S:The fact that the same symbolic programming primitives work for those as work

*:OOP
B:OO Designs and implementation in Languages

*:OOP_1
I:[1] Paul Graham, "Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age"
S:Object-Oriented programming offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code.
 :It lets you accrete programs as a series of patches.

*:OOP_2
I:[2] Alan Kay
S:I invented the term 'Object-Oriented', and I can tell you I did not have C++
 :in mind.

*:OOP_3
I:[3] Roberto Waltman
S:In the one and only true way.  The object-oriented version of 'Spaghetti code',
 :is, of course, 'Lasagna code'.  (Too many layers).

*:OOP_4
I:[4] Joe Armstrong, inventor of Erlang
S:The problem with object-oriented languages is that they've got all this
 :implicit environment that they carry around with them.  You wanted a banana
 :but what you've got is a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.

*:OOP_5
I:[5] Anonymous
S:The great thing about Object-Oriented code is that it can make small,
 :simple problems look like a large, complex ones.

*:OOP_6
I:[6] Lasse Petersen
S:"Eiffel: The Programming Language" is certainly by far the most expensive piece
 :of fiction on my bookshelf.  Excellent, entertaining fiction, but it remains
 :fiction nevertheless.

*:OOP_7
I:[7] Ed Yourdon
S:A system composed of 100,000 lines of C++ is not be sneezed at, but we don't
 :have that much trouble developing 100,000 lines of COBOL today.  The real test
 :of OOP will come when systems of 1 to 10 million lines of code are developed.

*:OOP_8
I:[8] phluid
S:I won't program in Java anymore.  I'm not Marxist and don't believe in classes.

*:OOP_9
I:[9] Bill Joy
S:I fear that new object-oriented systems may suffer the fate of Lisp, in that
 :they can do many things, but the complexity of the class hierarchies may
 :cause them to collapse under their own weight.

*:OOP_10
I:[10] Alan Kay
S:Java is the most distressing thing to happen to computing since MS-DOS.

*:OOP_11
I:[11] Thant Tessman
S:OO is like the Bible in that which scripture is to be interpreted metaphori-
 :cally, and which is to be interpreted literally, is entirely a function of the
 :religious agenda of the commentator.  My own advice is to keep in mind that
 :the stuff of computer programs is nothing but metaphor.

*:OOP_12
I:[12] Paul Graham, "ANSI Common Lisp"
S:The object-oriented model makes it easy to build programs by accretion.
 :What this often means, in practice, is that it provides a structured way to
 :write spaghetti code.  This is not necessarily bad, but it is not entirely
 :good either.
 :
 :A lot of code in the real world is spaghetti code, and this is probably not
 :going to change soon.  For programs that would have ended up as spaghetti
 :anyway, the object-oriented model is good: they will at least be structured
 :spaghetti.  But for programs that might otherwise have avoided this fate,
 :object-oriented abstractions could be more dangerous than useful.

*:OOP_13
I:[13] Richard P. Gabriel, "Objects have failed", OOPSLA 2002
S:Bricks are just too limited, and the circumstances where they make sense are
 :too constrained to serve as a model for building something as diverse and
 :unpredictable as a city.  And further, the city itself is not the end goal,
 :because the city must also -in the best case- be a humane structure for human
 :activity, which requires a second set of levels of complexity and concerns.
 :Using this metaphor to talk about future computing systems, it's fair to say
 :that OO addresses concerns at the level of bricks.
 :
 :Despite the early clear understanding of the nature of software development by
 :OO pioneers, the current caretakers of the ideas have reverted to the incumbent
 :philosophy of perfect planning, grand design, and omniscience inherited
 :from Babbage's theology.

*:OOP_14
I:[14] Rob Pike
S:Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing.

*:OOP_15
I:[15] D. Gelernter, "Machine Beauty"
S:Object-oriented programming as it emerged in Simula 67 allows software
 :structure to be based on real-world structures, and gives programmers a
 :powerful way to simplify the design and construction of complex programs.

*:OOP_16
I:[16] Bertrand Meyer, "ITWorld.com"
S:All I can really say by way of a reasonably short comment is that inheritance
 :is a very flexible mechanism.  It's possible and in fact fairly common to misuse
 :it, but that's not a reason to distrust it systematically as seems to have
 :become the fashion.

*:OOP_17
I:[17] Bertrand Meyer, "ITWorld.com"
S:One problem I have with a good deal of the literature is that it is based on
 :a view of inheritance strongly or even solely determined by knowledge of the
 :mechanisms of C++ and Java.  I think that to understand the scope of inheritance
 :one must look beyond these two languages, which are each the products of a
 :specific time, a specific frame of mind, a specific market, and a specific
 :frame of mind. One should learn from them but not be restricted by their view
 :of the world. 

*:OOP_18
I:[18] Charles Petzold, "Programming MS Windows with C#"
S:In a sense, the whole history of new programming languages and class libraries
 :for Windows has involved the struggle to reduce the windows hello-world program
 :down to something small, sleek, and elegant.

*:OOP_19
I:[19] Paul Graham
S:The object-oriented model makes it easy to build up programs by accretion.
 :What this often means, in practice, is that it provides a structured way to
 :write spaghetti code.

*:OOP_20
I:[20] Rob Pike
S:Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing.

*:OOP_21
I:[21] Edsger Dijkstra
S:Object-Oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could have
 :originated in California.

*:OOP_22
I:[22] James H. Clark

 :programming system made programming the Mac and iPhone so easy.

S:Using PL/I must be like flying a plane with 7,000 buttons, switches, and

*:LEGACY_24
I:[24] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:When Fortran has been called infantile disorder, PL/I, with its growth

*:LEGACY_25
I:[25] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:PL/I, "the fatal disease", belongs more to the problem set than

S:C treats you like a consenting adult.  Pascal treats you like a naughty child.

S:There are a couple of people in the world who can really program in C or

 :Most programmers aren't that good.  The problem is that those few programmers

*:LEGACY_28
I:[28] Edsger W. Dijkstra
S:APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection.  It is the language of the
 :future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation
 :of coding bums. 

*:LEGACY_29
I:[29] John C. Reynolds
S:Another line of development stemming from Algol 60 has led to languages such as
 :Pascal and its descendants, e.g. Euclid, Mesa, and Ada, which are significantly
